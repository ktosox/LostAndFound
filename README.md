# LostAndFound

## What is this?
A repo for this game jam: https://itch.io/jam/neurosama-birthday-game-jam

with the theme : LOST AND FOUND

I'm using the repo description as a GDD because

## What's the plan?

I want to make a card game - in about 31 hours as of writing this (sleep not included) - and I don't feel like working with humans at the moment, so I'm going alone.

So the plan is to create a simple single-player card game (like Cultist Simulator AKA CS) - but different. I don't like the real-time clocks from CS, as well as how hectic it becomes with scale.

I want this game: making choices and 

## How will it be connected to the theme?

I feel like going with a dual approach.

I want Finding and Losing to be mechanics in-game - Finding would work like the Discover mechanic in Hearthstone (the player is presented with up to 3 cards from a specific group, from which they get to keep one), while Losing... not sure yet, will update later hopefully.

What I also want to explore in the story is the concept of what makes one "self". So memories - both impactful and seemingly insignificant, stuff that triggers memories, self-discovery, self-sacrifice for self and for others.

All of the above will be connected by the concept of **LOSING** what makes people what they are as well as **FINDING** out stuff about the dream world and other agents.

## The Story

Game starts with an announcement that "the ritual was successful", and that "you have breached the dream world". The player needs to **FIND** their way to *something*, or risk becoming **LOST** like the countless soles that ventured here before.

The game takes 


## Core mechanics (needs to work ASAP)

- Cards - need to be draggable, need to interact with other objects

- Board - where the game takes place

- Printing messages to the player - subtitles are optional for the player, not the creator

- Deck building / drafting - before the game starts the player needs to make choices that define their game deck. Currently I see it as selecting 2-4 groups of around 6-10 cards each that will make the game deck. (it should probably be a blind pick on first run with a "more details" option that allows to see what cards will be added by each choice)

## Bonus mechanics (stuff that could be cool, but is non-essential

- Fog of war - hide parts of the Board like in an RTS (not visible, gray, visible)

- 4 key stats - I'm thinking something as general as 2 power centric attributes (example offense/defense) and 2 stamina centric attributes (example stamina bar size/stamina bar regeneration)
